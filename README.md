# Sign Language Detection Training

This is a fork of the [TensorFlow implementation](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/sign_language_detection) of the model proposed in
[Real-Time Sign Language Detection using Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04637),
published in SLRTP 2020.

In this fork, we add data loading and training for Holistic pose estimation.

This model is used in the
[Real-TIme Sign Language Detection for Videoconferencing](https://youtu.be/nozz2pvbG_Q)
demo published in ECCV 2020.

## Models

This repository includes pre-trained models for both python and javascript.

## Usage

You can use the included models to perform inference or fine-tuning.

To load a model in python, use
`tensorflow.python.keras.models.load_model('models/py/model.h5')`.

To load a model in the browser, use `tf.loadLayersModel('models/js/model.json')`
from [tfjs](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs).

You can use the [train.py](train.py) script to train the model from scratch
using a `tfrecord` dataset file.

```bash
python -m train --dataset_path="data.tfrecord" --device="/GPU:0"
```

## Dataset

The dataset is represented as a `tfrecord` file where each video has 4
properties: 
1. `fps`:`Int64List` - the framerate of the video 
1. `pose_data`:`BytesList` - human pose estimation, as a tensor of the shape
`(frames, 1, points, dimensions)` 
1. `pose_confidence`:`BytesList` - human pose
estimation confidence, as a tensor of the shape `(frames, 1, points)`0
1. `is_signing`:`BytesList` - a bytes object representing weather the user was
signing or not in every frame.

Please see `examples/create_tfrecord.py` for an example of creating this record.

The provided models were trained on the
[Public DGS Corpus](https://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/meinedgs/ling/start-name_en.html).

To create the data files using the dgs corpus, *TODO*
